# Meteorites in Antarctica - Interactivity Enhancement

This project aims to enhance the previous [Meteorites in Antarctica](https://takumanken.github.io/major-studio-1-code/quantitave_data/code/app/) visualization by adding three new interactive features:

## Scope of Enhancement

### 1. Interactive Filter for Histogram
Add filtering capabilities to the histograms on the left (Weight and Collected Year) to allow users to explore meteorites based on specific criteria of interest.

### 2. Zoom-In Feature
Introduce a zoom-in functionality on the map to enable users to closely examine specific areas, facilitating a more detailed exploration of meteorite distribution.

### 3. Antarctica Landmass Contour
Add contour lines to represent elevation across Antarctica, providing users with additional geographic context to better understand meteorite collection locations.
