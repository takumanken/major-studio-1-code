# Interactive Data Visualization Sketches

## Meteorites in Antarctica - Interactivity Enhancement

This project aims to enhance the previous [Meteorites in Antarctica](https://takumanken.github.io/major-studio-1-code/quantitave_data/code/app/) visualization by adding three new interactive features:

### Scope of Enhancement

#### 1. Interactive Filter for Histogram
Add filtering capabilities to the histograms on the left (Weight and Collected Year) to allow users to explore meteorites based on specific criteria of interest.

#### 2. Zoom-In Feature
Introduce a zoom-in functionality on the map to enable users to closely examine specific areas, facilitating a more detailed exploration of meteorite distribution.

#### 3. Antarctica Landmass Contour
Add contour lines to represent elevation across Antarctica, providing users with additional geographic context to better understand meteorite collection locations.

### Considerations
Data Availability: Displaying Antarctica’s elevation contours may require advanced geoprocessing tools, such as QGIS, to prepare the data accurately for integration.
Interactive Filter Implementation: Implementing the filter to align precisely with the design may require advanced coding techniques.

## Uncover the Moment - Interactivity Enhancement

This project aims to enhance the previous [Uncover the Moment](https://takumanken.github.io/major-studio-1-code/qualitative_data/app/code/index.html) visualization by adding new interactive features.

### Scope of Enhancement

### 1. Cover Page: Adding Animation Effect to the title
Add animation effects to the main and subtitles on the cover page to draw users’ attention.

### 2. Gallery Page: Adding Sort Control and Scrolling Effect
Implement a sorting control on the gallery page to improve the user experience when searching and browsing. Also, smooth scrolling effect will be added to create a more interactive and fluid user experience.

### 3. Gallery Page: Adding number of hits of filter
Display the number of results or "hits" that match the current filter criteria, allowing users to see how many portraits will be shown before they apply a filter.

### 4. Description Page: Adding Chat-bot feature (Optional)
Introduce an chatbot feature on the description page, enabling users to ask questions and gain deeper insights about the content. Careful controls will be implemented to minimize AI-generated misinformation ("hallucinations"), ensuring responses remain relevant and within information avaialable from specified source.
