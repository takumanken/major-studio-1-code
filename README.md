# Major Studio 1 Projects
This document is the final submission for my project, which I developed in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution during the Major Studio 1 class in the Fall Semester of 2024, as part of the MS Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design.

## 1. Uncover the moment

This project aims to help viewers understand the background information for each portrait in the Smithsonian's portrait collection. Alongside the details provided through [Smithsonian Open Access](https://www.si.edu/openaccess), this visualization incorporates AI-generated summaries using [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/). These summaries include general information about the sitter and insights into what this moment in the sitter's life might have been like. To minimize the risk of AI hallucinations, the project adopts an approach where the AI summarizes external information instead of generating descriptions from scratch.


## 2. Why are meteorites found in Antarctica?

This project is a scrolly-telling narrative that delves into the fact that many meteorites are found in Antarctica and explains the fascinating reasons behind this phenomenon. It is the second iteration of my qualitative project, [Meteorites in Antarctica](https://takumanken.github.io/major-studio-1-code/quantitave_data/code/app/), originally aimed for an exploratory analysis interface of Antarctica's meteorites. This updated version emphasizes storytelling, combining data visualizations and illustrations to provide viewers with deeper insights and a more engaging experience. The structure and sentences in each section are carefully designed to balance precision, clarity, and engagement.
