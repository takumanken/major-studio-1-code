# Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute - Photo Collection
This visualization allows users to explore the Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute's extensive animal photo collection through an intuitive search system based on biological classification. Each classification is represented as a circle, with animal photos displayed at the tree's edge. The size of each circle corresponds to the number of photos it contains, with the count also labeled within each circle. A drill-down feature enables users to click on a classification to view species-specific details and related photos.
This visualization uses the collection's biological classification metadata, encompassing approximately one thousand data points. A hypertree chart is employed to effectively represent the hierarchical structure.
