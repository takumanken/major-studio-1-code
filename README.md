This visualization allows users to explore the Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute's extensive animal photo collection through an intuitive search system based on biological classification. Each classification is represented as a circle, with animal photos displayed at the tree's edge. The size of each circle corresponds to the number of photos it contains, with the count also labeled within each circle. A drill-down feature enables users to click on a classification to view species-specific details and related photos.
This visualization uses the collection's biological classification metadata, encompassing approximately one thousand data points. A hypertree chart is employed to effectively represent the hierarchical structure.

# National Museum of American History - Timeline Search

This visualization allows users to explore the vast collection of the National Museum of American History through a timeline-based search. 
Each dot represents an individual item, and users can see what the item is by hovering over the dots to see a tooltip. The dots are stacked by year to show distribution and provide insight to users.
This visualization uses metadata such as date, object type, and subject to allow users to filter results based on their interests. The estimated number of data points will be approximately 2 million.
The visualization method used is a dot plot to effectively display the timeline and ensure that each historical item is highlighted equally.

This visualization allows users to explore the Antarctic meteorite collection based on a map UI.
As shown in Figure E, the first view of this UI is to show the entire Antarctic and visualize the number of meteorites on the density heatmap, grouped by binned latitude and longitude. As shown in Figure F, users can click on the density heatmap to see each instance on the screen.
This visualization uses the latitude and longitude metadata for the density map and also uses collection date, weight, and radius as filters. The estimated number of data points is 55000.
The map visualization is used to let the user know where the meteorite was collected.
